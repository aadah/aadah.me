			<blockquote><p>And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers -
			shriveled now, and brown and flat and brittle - to witness that even when
			mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived
			on in the heart of man.</p>

			<p class="salutation">&mdash; Excerpt from <i>The Time Machine</i>

			<h2>The Authors</h2>

			<h3>Abdi-Hakin Dirie</h3>

			<p>Abdi-Hakin - more casually known as Abdi - was born in
			Mogadishu, Somalia, the nation's capitol. With the outbreak of the
			ongoing Somali Civil War, Abdi moved to the States as an early immigrant.
			After nearly a decade of residence, Abdi became a US citizen and now lives
			in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he is an undergraduate at MIT studying
			computer science and engineering. He has interests in artificial intelligence,
			education, and web development, among other things, and loves to read good
			science fiction when he is not working.</p>

			<h3>Ahmad Ali Diriye</h3>

			<p>Ahmad was born in the town of Beledweyne, Somalia. He also currently makes
			residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Before Massachusetts, Ahmad lived in
			Pennsylvania for quite sometime, and would periodically travel outside the US
			for random purposes. Now, Ahmad spends most of his time reading news and
			sitting in on public lectures on MIT's campus. He enjoys debating religion
			and ethics whenever he can, and has a passion for the cinema, photography,
			and languages. He also is a fervent cyclist when the season permits.</p>

			<h2>The Site</h2>

			<p>The site is a shared blog between Abdi and Ahmad. Both make posts independent
			of the other's input, except when they are writing a joint post. Topics are
			variable, from computer science to photography, with various other miscellanea
			in between. Abdi is more likely to write posts pertaining to code or academia,
			while Ahmad will tend to write on complementary topics. Fortunately, neither writes
			substantially more than the other, so there should be a healthy share of posts
			between the two.</p>

			<p>Periodically, a guest post will be put up on the site. Any assertions made in
			such posts are not necessarily reflective of the site's positions, but guest writers
			are encouraged to be interesting, and Abdi and Ahmad both agree that contrarian
			opinions achieve that best. As the writer and politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali once said,
			<q>With like-minded people one cannot discuss.</q> Indeed, like-mindedness is quite
			boring. We strive to avoid it.</p>

			<p>The site takes on a light or dark theme depending on the local time. The
			light theme is up from 6:00-18:00. The dark theme is up during the complementary
			interval. The theme transitions at the interval boundaries. The times are chosen
			to (very roughly) correspond to sunrise and sunset hours.</p>
