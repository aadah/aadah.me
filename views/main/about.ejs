			mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived
			on in the heart of man.</p>

			<h2>The Authors</h2>

			<h3>Abdi-Hakin Dirie</h3>

			<p>Abdi-Hakin - also known as Abdi - was born in Mogadishu, Somalia. With the outbreak of the
			ongoing Somali Civil War, Abdi moved to the States as a young immigrant.
			After nearly a decade of residence, Abdi became a US citizen and now lives
			in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he is a software engineer with a focus in
      machine learning and natural language processing. He has interests in artificial
      intelligence, comedy, and web development, among other things.</p>

			<h3>Ahmed Ali Diriye</h3>

			<p>Ahmed was born in Beledweyne, Somalia. He also currently makes
			residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts, though he travels very often.
      (Traveling is a great yet underrated way of learning, according to him.)
      He enjoys discussing philosophy, especially ethics, whenever possible, and
      likes photography, languages, and all things cinema.
      He likes to ride his vintage road bicycle when the season permits.</p>

			<h2>The Site</h2>

			<p>The site is a shared blog between Abdi and Ahmed. Topics are
			variable, from computer science to photography, with various other miscellanea
			in between. Abdi is more likely to write posts on technical topics like programming,
			while Ahmed will tend to write on other, non-intersecting topics like culture.
      Neither writes substantially more than the other, so there is usually an
      even share of posts between the two.</p>

			<p>The site takes on a light or dark theme depending on the local time. The
			light theme is up from 6:00-18:00. The dark theme is up during the complementary
			interval. The theme transitions at the interval boundaries. The times are chosen
			to roughly correspond to sunrise and sunset hours.</p>
