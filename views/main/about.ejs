			mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived
			on in the heart of man.</p>

			<h2>The Authors</h2>

			<h3>Abdi-Hakin Dirie</h3>

			<p>Abdi-Hakin—Abdi for short—was born in Mogadishu, Somalia. With the
			outbreak of the Somali Civil War, he came to the United States as a
			refugee. After a decade of residence, he became a US citizen and now lives
			in Brooklyn, New York where he is a software engineer with a focus in
			machine learning and natural language processing. He has interests in
			artificial intelligence, comedy, and effective giving, among other
			things.</p>

			<h3>Ahmed Ali Diriye</h3>

			<p>Ahmed was born in Beledweyne, Somalia. He also currently makes
			residence in Brooklyn, though he travels very often. In the past he has
			been to Greece, Peru, Japan, Ethiopia, and Canada. He enjoys discussing
			philosophy, especially ethics, whenever possible, and likes photography,
			languages, and all things cinema. He likes to ride his vintage road
			bicycle when the season permits.</p>

			<h2>The Site</h2>

			<p>The site is a shared blog between Abdi and Ahmed. Topics are variable,
			from computer science to philosophy. Neither writes substantially more
			than the other, so there is usually an even share of posts between the
			two.</p>

			<p>The site takes on a light or dark theme depending on the local time.
			The light theme is up from 6:00-18:00. The dark theme is up during the
			complementary interval. The theme transitions at the interval boundaries.
			The times are chosen to roughly correspond with sunrise and sunset.</p>
